# Hi, I'm Joe Maclean

I'm a Full-Stack Developer with strong experience in TypeScript, Node.js, Angular, React, SQL, and cloud-based web applications.  
I enjoy building real-world features end-to-end from backend database logic and APIs to polished frontend UI components.

I'm currently completing my Bachelor of Computer Science and have worked on multiple industry-grade capstone projects, including BirdMark and OnTrack, where I contributed production-quality backend and frontend features.
