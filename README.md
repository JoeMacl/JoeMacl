# Welcome, 

I'm a full-stack developer with experience across TypeScript, Node.js, Angular, React, and SQL.  
I enjoy building real features end-to-end — from backend logic and APIs to polished frontend UI.

I'm a final-year Computer Science student and have contributed to industry-grade projects including BirdMark (backend vetting system) and OnTrack (admin-facing Angular features).
